This file contains the essential findings of the kickoff meeting on 2010/09/27.
Attendees: howard, motteneder

Working title of the game: Zombienation

Game modes:
  * Travel from one place to another.
  * Fortify a given place and defend it for a certain period of time.
  * Rebuild: Select a place, fortify it, and create a system to provide the
    survivors with supplies and security.
  * Campaign: Combines the above game modes and variations of them with a
    continuous story.
  Rebuild and Campaign put a heavier focus on managing ressources than the
  other game modes.
  All modes should work for a single player as well as multiple players, the
  main difference being that the other survivors are controlled by AI in single
  player mode, whereas other players may control the remaining survivors in
  multiplayer mode.

Features:
  The following list of intended features does not represent set-in-stone goals
  of the project. Features may be added or removed any time.
  * Savegames: Necessary for long game modes such as Rebuild and Campaign. In
    SP games, the save file may be saved on the client's computer in whatever
    way we decide to use to store such information persistently. MP savegames
    should remain saved on the server to prevent, or, alternatively, any player
    may distribute one of his savegames to others who want to join.
  * Action view and management view: Different views for different purposes.
    Action view is intended for letting the characters run around, fight the
    undead, and look for items. Management view provides an overview of the
    whole map (or at least the discovered parts), which is ideal for getting
    orientation, reviewing your goals, and ordering others to do something.
  * Items: Should be placed randomly, but within certain constraints. For
    example, it's plausible to find a chainsaw in the garage, but not in the
    living room. For early versions, however, static placing of items on the
    map should suffice. A characters carrying capacity should be limited, but
    extendable with carrying equipment, such as backpacks or tool belts. The
    amount of carried items should also influence agility. When finding an
    item, it should be possible to choose hiding it from other survivors (as
    opposed to claiming an item for the group). Using the item in front of
    others should affect your trustworthiness, though.
  * Music: Tracks licensed for free re-use would be ideal. As a low-priority
    improvement of this feature, music could be selected to match the current
    atmosphere in the game, like fast aggressive songs for combat situations.
  * Characters: The player characters and NPCs should have some attributes like
    strength, agility, intelligence, trustworthiness, loyalty... oh wait, this
    sounds too much like RPG. But some attributes would be really useful to
    provide richer gameplay. Those attributes could be generated randomly for
    every game, or every user can create a character to use every time.
  * Parameterized zombies: Similar to characters, zombies also should have
    certain attributes which are randomly generated at the beginning of the
    game/campaign, so that the player(s) have to research them before knowing
    how they act, providing more realistic zombie apocalypse conditions.
  * Score system: Killing zombies, fortifying, and surviving should be rewarded
    with points. We could also introduce achievements for certain deeds. There
    should be an online ranking with the top players.
  * Communication via chat: With messages appearing as speech bubbles above the
    character.
  * Compatibility with mobile devices: Such as iOS or Android devices. This
    means, essentially, that the game should not require too high resolutions
    and should be touch-control friendy.
  * [low priority]Particle engine: For smoke/fires, but still subject to
    research.
  * [possible]Times of day: Probably best doable when using SVG for the
    game graphics.
  * [possible]Offline mode: SP only, of course.

Possibly used technologies:
  * <canvas>, possibly with mootools canvas library.
  * node.js or WebSocket for communication with the server/other players.
  * WebStorage or Web SQL Databases for storing frequently used ressources on
    the user side for quicker game loading.
  Some of the technologies above still need some experimenting before we can
  decide which to use.

Goals:
  Divided into steps we want to take in this sequence.
  * Displaying and animating stuff, using <canvas>.
  * Positioning objects and moving the player over a map.
  * Path finding for anything that moves around.
  * AI for zombies and NPCs.
  --> This is how far we want to get till the end of the year.
  * Multiplayer mode.
  * Collecting and managing items.
  * Using weapons and items.
  * Game mode logic.
  * Savegames.
  * Campaign.

Problems:
  * Graphics: No useful sources confirmed so far. We need someone who is good
    with CGs.
